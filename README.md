# python-pulsk-crawler

This Python project is a simple web crawler designed to explore and extract data from the pulsk.com website.

* Initialization: The crawler begins its journey by setting the starting point as the pulsk.com website. It's like setting a destination for a road trip.
* Navigation: The crawler then embarks on its journey. It sends a request to the website to download the HTML content of the page. It's like opening the map and starting the car.
* Exploration: Once the HTML content is downloaded, the crawler starts exploring the page. It looks for all the links present on the page, much like a tourist exploring a new city.
* Following Links: The crawler then follows each link it finds, much like a road trip where you visit each city on your map. It adds these links to a queue of URLs to visit.
* Repeating the Process: The crawler continues this process, visiting each URL in the queue, exploring the page, finding new links, and adding them to the queue. It's like a never-ending road trip where you keep visiting new cities.
* Completion: The crawler continues this process until it has visited all the URLs it can find, much like a road trip where you've visited all the cities on your map.

This project is designed to serve as a learning tool for creating simple website crawlers using Python.
